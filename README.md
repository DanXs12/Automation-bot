# Ketex-Automation-bot

As Ketex, I blend over a decade of IT experience with a deep focus on blockchain technology, which began in 2021. I run a cutting-edge data center with local servers and cloud services to support seamless node operations.

My role involves supporting blockchain projects through all stagesâ€”development, testing, and mainnet launches. As a software engineer and crypto exchange specialist, I am passionate about developing dapps, especially during testnets.

With extensive experience in web3, I've worked with various testnets and blockchain nodes, including Sei, Sui, and Aptos, establishing myself as a trusted and innovative figure in the blockchain community.
